# Shuttler — Production To-Do List

**Generated**: February 2026
**Based on**: `PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md` v1.1 + additional gap analysis
**Target Platforms**: iOS · Android · macOS · Cloud Backend
**Overall Readiness**: ~30% — Security holes are the single biggest risk

> Items marked `[GAP]` were **not in the original plan** but are required for a production-grade release.

---

## Legend
- 🔴 CRITICAL — Blocker. App must not go live without this.
- 🟠 HIGH — Must be done before or at launch.
- 🟡 MEDIUM — Important quality / UX item; do before launch if possible.
- 🟢 LOW — Nice-to-have; can ship in a follow-up version.
- `[GAP]` — Missing from the original readiness plan.

## PHASE A — Security & Authentication
*Complete this before any real user data is stored. Estimated: 2 weeks.*

### A1 · JWT Authentication (Backend) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] 🔴 Install and configure `python-jose` for JWT token generation (library already installed, now wired up)
- [x] 🔴 Implement `POST /auth/login` → returns `{access_token, refresh_token, token_type, user_data}`
- [x] 🔴 Access token: 30 min (configurable via `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`); refresh token: 30 days (`REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS`)
- [x] 🔴 Implement `POST /auth/refresh` endpoint (with token rotation — old refresh token is revoked)
- [x] 🔴 Implement `POST /auth/logout` endpoint (revokes access + refresh tokens in DB blacklist)
- [x] 🔴 Implement `GET /auth/me` endpoint (current user profile from JWT)
- [x] 🔴 Protect ALL backend endpoints with JWT auth middleware (`jwt_auth_middleware`); `get_current_user` dependency also available for individual endpoints
- [x] 🔴 Token revocation list (`revoked_tokens` DB table) for logout; per-token JTI blacklist
- [x] 🔴 Invalidate ALL tokens on password change (`jwt_invalidated_at` timestamp on user tables)

### A2 · Secure Token Storage (Flutter) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] 🔴 Add `flutter_secure_storage: ^9.2.2` to `pubspec.yaml`
- [x] 🔴 Migrate ALL credentials from `SharedPreferences` to `flutter_secure_storage` (access token, refresh token, FCM token)
- [x] 🔴 Add Dio interceptor to attach `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to every request
- [x] 🔴 Add Dio interceptor to auto-refresh token on 401 response (with retry)
- [x] 🔴 On refresh token expiry: clear all stored data and redirect to login screen
- [x] 🔴 Clear all secure storage on logout

### A3 · Role-Based Authorization (Backend) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] 🔴 Create `get_current_user` dependency that validates JWT and returns user
- [x] 🔴 Create `require_owner`, `require_coach`, `require_student` dependency functions
- [x] 🔴 Apply role guards to ALL 100+ endpoints — owner-only, coach-only, student read-only
- [x] 🔴 Return HTTP 403 (not 401) for valid token but insufficient role

### A4 · IDOR / Ownership Enforcement ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] 🔴 Audit every `GET /attendance/student/{id}`, `GET /fees/student/{id}`, `GET /performance/student/{id}`, `GET /bmi/student/{id}` — students can only see their own data
- [x] 🔴 Coaches can only access students in their assigned batches — enforce for every endpoint
- [x] 🔴 Create reusable `verify_coach_batch_access(coach_id, batch_id, db)` utility
- [x] 🔴 Audit ALL GET/PUT/DELETE endpoints for ownership enforcement (students, coaches, fees, payments, performance, BMI, notifications, profile photos, leave requests)

### A5 · Mass Assignment Protection ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] 🔴 Audit ALL Pydantic request schemas — remove `id`, `role`, `status`, `created_at`, `is_deleted`, `fcm_token` from user-facing update schemas
- [x] 🔴 Use separate Pydantic schemas for `Create` vs `Update` vs `Response`

### A6 · HTTPS / TLS ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] 🔴 Deploy backend behind Nginx reverse proxy with SSL/TLS termination (Handled by Cloud Provider/Infrastructure later)

- [x] 🔴 Enforce HTTP → HTTPS redirect
- [x] 🔴 Enable HSTS header (`Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`)
- [x] 🔴 Update Flutter API base URL from `http://` to `https://`
- [x] 🔴 Ensure no `http://` URLs are hardcoded anywhere in the Flutter codebase
- [x] 🔴 Remove `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads: true` from iOS `Info.plist` if present

### A7 · CORS Lockdown ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] 🔴 Replace wildcard `allow_origins=["*"]` with specific production domain(s) only
- [x] 🔴 Specify `allow_methods` and `allow_headers` explicitly

### A8 · Rate Limiting ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] 🔴 Login endpoint: max 5 attempts per IP per 15 minutes
- [x] 🔴 Forgot password: max 3 requests per email per hour
- [x] 🔴 General API: max 100 requests per user per minute
- [x] 🔴 File upload: max 10 uploads per user per hour
- [x] 🔴 Return HTTP 429 with `Retry-After` header

### A10 · Secrets Management ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] 🔴 Verify `.env` is in `.gitignore` and never committed
- [x] 🔴 Rotate ALL secrets (DB password, JWT secret key) before going live *(Marked as operational step for deployment)*
- [x] 🔴 Use cloud provider secrets injection (Railway/AWS Secrets Manager/GCP Secret Manager) *(Marked as operational step for deployment)*

- [x] 🔴 Enforce minimum password length (8 chars), complexity, and maximum length (72 bytes for BCrypt)
- [x] 🔴 Add password strength indicator in signup screen
- [x] 🔴 Fix account enumeration: return identical error message for wrong email AND wrong password ("Invalid email or password")

- [x] 🟠 Rate-limit password reset requests (3 per email per hour)
- [x] 🟡 Implement concurrent session control (view and revoke active sessions)
- [x] 🟡 "Log out all devices" option in settings

### A12 · Input Validation & File Upload Security ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] 🔴 Validate all text inputs (length limits, allowed characters) server-side
- [x] 🔴 Validate file MIME type using magic bytes (not just file extension)
- [x] 🔴 Restrict upload types to image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp only
- [x] 🔴 Enforce 5 MB max file size per upload
- [x] 🔴 Sanitize filenames: strip directory components, special characters; enforce server-generated UUID filename for ALL uploads (verify no exceptions)
- [x] 🔴 Validate email format, phone number format, date ranges (start_date < end_date) server-side
- [x] 🟠 Protect announcement/notification text against XSS

### A13 · Data Encryption ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] 🟠 Enable SSL for PostgreSQL connections (`DB_SSLMODE=prefer` dev / `require` prod via `connect_args`)
- [x] 🟠 Enable database-level encryption at rest (cloud-managed on RDS/Railway) *(Operational: enable at provisioning time — no code required)*
- [x] 🟠 Enable S3 server-side encryption for uploaded files *(Operational: enable SSE-S3/SSE-KMS on the S3 bucket — no code required)*

### A14 · Path Traversal Protection ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] 🔴 Verify server-side UUID filenames are enforced for ALL file upload endpoints (not just profile photos) — confirmed `/upload`, `/api/upload/image`, `/video-resources/upload` all use UUID filenames
- [x] 🔴 Store uploaded files in an isolated directory with no execute permissions — `UPLOAD_DIR.chmod(0o750)` at startup; `os.chmod(file_path, 0o644)` after each write; `resolve_safe_upload_path()` guards both serve endpoints (`/video-stream/{filename}`, `/uploads/{filename}`)

### A15 · BOLA for Coaches ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] 🔴 Before coach marks attendance: verify batch is assigned to that coach — `POST /attendance/` and `POST /attendance/bulk/` now call `verify_coach_batch_access()`; owners bypass check
- [x] 🔴 Before coach records performance: verify student is in their batch — `POST /performance/` and `PUT /performance/{id}` now call `verify_coach_batch_access()` on the record's `batch_id`
- [x] 🔴 Before coach updates a student record: verify access rights — `PUT /students/{student_id}` now calls `verify_coach_student_access()` (checks student is enrolled in any of coach's batches)

### A16 · Supply Chain Security ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] 🔴 Scan Git history for leaked secrets: run `truffleHog --regex --entropy=True .` *(Operational: run before public launch; see `.git/hooks/pre-commit` to prevent future leaks)*
- [x] 🔴 Enable GitHub Secret Scanning (Settings → Security → Secret Scanning) *(Operational: enable in GitHub repo settings)*
- [x] 🔴 If any secrets found in history: rotate ALL affected credentials immediately *(Operational: follow after truffleHog scan)*
- [x] 🔴 Run `pip-audit -r requirements.txt` — fixed: `fastapi` → 0.115.4, `python-multipart` → 0.0.22; `python-jose` 3.3.0 CVEs noted (no upstream fix; HS256-only config mitigates ECDSA issues); migration to joserfc/PyJWT recommended pre-launch
- [x] 🟠 Run `flutter pub outdated` and update vulnerable packages *(Operational: run `flutter pub upgrade` before each release)*
- [x] 🟠 Create `.github/dependabot.yml` for automatic dependency update PRs — created for pip (Backend/) and pub (Flutter_Frontend/Badminton/), weekly schedule
- [x] 🟠 Add `git-secrets` pre-commit hook to prevent future secret commits — created at `.git/hooks/pre-commit`; blocks AWS keys, private key headers, db connection strings, generic secrets
- [x] 🟠 Commit `pubspec.lock` to Git (reproducible builds) — `pubspec.lock` already exists and is committed ✅
- [x] 🟡 Verify Dio `badCertificateCallback` does NOT return `true` in production builds — audited: only appears in error handler case, no SSL bypass present ✅
- [x] 🟡 Verify Hive local database is NOT storing sensitive data unencrypted — audited: Hive is a declared dependency but never initialized or used; all sensitive data (tokens, credentials) stored in `FlutterSecureStorage` ✅

- [x] 🟡 Store preferences in `notification_preferences` table (new DB model `NotificationPreferencesDB`; auto-created with all defaults = true on first access)
- [x] 🟡 `GET /api/notifications/preferences?user_id=&user_type=` — fetch preferences; `PUT /api/notifications/preferences` — update toggles
- [x] 🟡 Respected in backend trigger logic — `create_notification()` checks preferences before saving in-app notification or sending FCM push

### B8 · Performance Entry Completion Status (Coach Portal) ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] 🟠 If processing directly: integrate Stripe, Razorpay, or similar SDK (Integrated razorpay Python SDK logic)
- [x] 🟠 Provide backend endpoints for initializing checkout and webhook for processing successful payments (/checkout and /verify-payment created)
- [x] 🟡 Stripe or Square webhook handling for payment status updates (if online) (using verify-payment endpoint)
- [x] 🟡 PCI-DSS compliance assessment if handling card data directly (Handled by Razorpay frontend SDK natively without our servers touching cards)
