Warning: A call to tap() with finder "Found 1 widget with text "Sign In": [
  Text("Sign In", inherit: true, color: Color(alpha: 1.0000, red: 0.9098, green: 0.9098, blue: 0.9098, colorSpace: ColorSpace.sRGB), size: 16.0, weight: 600, textAlign: center, overflow: ellipsis, maxLines: 1, dependencies: [DefaultSelectionStyle, DefaultTextStyle, MediaQuery]),
]" derived an Offset (Offset(414.0, 663.5)) that would not hit test on the specified widget.
Maybe the widget is actually off-screen, or another widget is obscuring it, or the widget cannot receive pointer events.
Indeed, Offset(414.0, 663.5) is outside the bounds of the root of the render tree, Size(800.0, 600.0).
The finder corresponds to this RenderBox: RenderParagraph#f595c relayoutBoundary=up21
The hit test result at that offset is: HitTestResult(HitTestEntry<HitTestTarget>#f21ab(_ReusableRenderView#b0e41), HitTestEntry<HitTestTarget>#76230(<AutomatedTestWidgetsFlutterBinding>))
